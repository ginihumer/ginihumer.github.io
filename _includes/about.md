I am currently doing my PhD at [Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria](https://www.jku.at/) at the [Visual Data Science Lab](https://jku-vds-lab.at/) under the supervision of [Prof. Marc Streit](https://jku-vds-lab.at/persons/streit/).
My PhD focuses on increasing human understanding of machine learning techniques by combining XAI and visual analytics techniques.
I completed my BSc in Computer Science and my MSc in Data Science at the Johannes Kepler University Linz. 

During my PhD, I did a research exchange at the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) for three months under the supervision of [Dr. Hendrik Strobelt](http://hendrik.strobelt.com/) where I worked on interpretation techniques for understanding multi-modal models.
Recently, I completed an internship at the [Mila Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en) under the supervision of [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/). In this project my research focused on using machine learning for accelerating scientific discoveries for climate change mitigation. In an ongoing collaboration with David Rolnick's Lab, we develop an active learning algorithm for designing electrocatalysts using GFlowNet for catalyst generation. 

Climate change mitigation is a big personal interest. I am part of [klimadashboard.org](https://klimadashboard.org/) - a group of volunteers intending to make the climate crisis better comprehendible. In an attempt to merge my personal and professional interests, I have been supervising student projects and theses with a focus on climate change. In the coming years, I am keen to direct my research more towards climate change mitigation using AI and visual analytics.
